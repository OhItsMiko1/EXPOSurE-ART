### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build Tools**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type-safe component
develonment
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast HMR (Hot
Module Replacement)
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing instead of React
Router
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling with custom theme configuration
**State Management & Data Fetching**
-TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and data synchronization

**UI Component Strategy**
- Radix Ul primitives for accessible, unstyled component foundations
- shaden/ui design system built on top of Radix with TailwindCSS
styling
- Custom theme system using JSON configuration for dynamic color schemes
- Responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach
**Form Handling**
- React Hook Form for performant form state management
- Zod for runtime schema validation
- @hookform/resolvers for seamless integration between the two
